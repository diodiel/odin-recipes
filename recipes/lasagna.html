    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Prepare the Meat Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef 
            and Italian sausage, breaking them apart as they cook.</li>
        <li>Once browned, add diced onion and minced garlic. Cook 
            until the onions are translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. 
            Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add basil, oregano, sugar, and season with salt and pepper. 
            Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring 
            occasionally.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, 
            Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, and salt. Mix until smooth and 
            set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble the Lasagna</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 
            9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce (overlapping slightly
            if needed).</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then top with
            1/3 of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process two more times: noodles, ricotta mixture,
            meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles and spread the remaining meat 
            sauce on top. Sprinkle generously with shredded mozzarella.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Bake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (sprayed with cooking spray to 
            prevent sticking).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes,
             until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Rest and Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Serve 
            warm with your favorite side salad or garlic bread.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your hearty, homemade lasagna!</p>
